Webscraping project - using websites the-numbers.com and rottentomatoes.com

Objective:
Explore whether the quality of movies have decreased over time, through analyzing the box office revenues in comparison to their production budget, and cross reference that with the popularity of the film (via RottenTomatoes ratings).

If audience continue to go to the movies (i.e. higher box office numbers) despite the quality of movies, the movie industry will keep putting out similar movies.



Questions:
What do audiences like?

Have their tastes changed?

What does it take for a movie to be profitable/for them to green light a movie?

It depends on a number of factors, but a rule of thumb seems to be that the film needs to make twice its production budget globally.

Has the quality of movies decreased in response to audience tastes?
